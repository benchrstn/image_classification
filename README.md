# Image Classification with CNN

## Project Overview
In this project, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is used for image classification on a shoulder implant dataset. The goal is to classify each shoulder implant image to the correct manufacturer. K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest are also implemented for comparison.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI repository - Shoulder Implant X-Ray Manufacturer Classification](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/517/shoulder+implant+x+ray+manufacturer+classification)

## Tools
- **Programming**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Library**: Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Numpy
